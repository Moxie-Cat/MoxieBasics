# MoxieBasics
Good morning! This is my basic template for new Godot projects.
It contains scripts for a handful of common elements, such as music and input remapping.

**NOTE:** This project relies on a small handful of third-party plugins!
I'll try to keep this template up-to-date, but if you need newer (or older) versions, check the [Depedencies](#dependencies) section below.
